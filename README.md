Welcome to the data and code repository for conferences and related projects. This repository is a resource for the following conferences:
- **Artificial Intelligence Research in Applied Linguistics (AIRiAL) Conference** at Teachers College, Columbia University
- **Decision Science Institute Conference** in Atlanta
  
<br>

### Overview:
This repository serves as a hub for data, code, and information related to the conferences mentioned above. 
It includes valuable resources for researchers and participants.

<br>

### Data:
The repository contains a variety of datasets and resources, including:
- **Preprocessed Enron Corpus**: A curated data collection from the Enron Corporation.
- **English Word Concretness Score Dictionary**: A dictionary for concreteness scores of English words.
- **Enron Company Employee Email Addresses and Positions**: Information on Enron company employees and their positions.
- **ChatGPT Generated Emails for Boss and to Boss**: Sample emails generated by ChatGPT for communication scenarios.

<br>

### Script:
- **Calculate Message Statistics:** Calculate key statistics for email messages, including the average concreteness score, and message length, and perform an ANOVA test for three power direction groups.
- **Create Word Clouds:** Generate word clouds to visually represent high and low concreteness score words within the Enron Corpus.
- **ChatGPT-Generated Emails:** Generate sample emails using ChatGPT for communication scenarios, both to and from the boss, to facilitate discussions.
- **Preprocessing Enron Corpus:** Explore different techniques and strategies for preprocessing the entire Enron Corpus, tailored for research purposes.
- **Email Analytics:** Perform email analytics, including left-on-read analysis, sentiment analysis, and calculation of time deltas between sent emails and their replies.
